        <h3>Are koalas an endangered species?</h3>

        <p>A quick Google search reveals that koalas are "not extinct", and that they are not on an endangered species list. 
            Whew - nothing to worry about, right? Well...not exactly. While there has been insightful backlash and complaints
            of exaggeration, many people are concerned about the dangers facing the koala populations, and Deborah Tabart, 
            head of the Australian Koala Foundation, went as far as to claim that koalas are "functionally extinct" in May of
            2019. So what exactly <i>is</i> going on?</p>

        <p>While recent news has sparked conversation about their future, koalas have been recognized as vulnerable for several
            years and the story of their declining numbers is, unfortunately, neither new nor different from that suffered by 
            many other species. All of the aspects of negative human impact on our world and its biodiversity can be found in 
            this story. Large numbers lost to satisfy human hunting and fur trading in the 19th and 20th centuries. The 
            <i>continued</i> destruction of their natural habitats, either by direct or indirect human intervention. Insufficient
            human protection efforts and reaction. The threat of motor vehicle accidents or dog attacks when displaced from their 
            environments and attempting to relocate. Except all of these factors are exacerbated by the lethargic and helpless 
            nature of these adorable and sleepy creatures. It is difficult for any species to cope with the destruction of their
            safe retreats and food supplies (Eucalyptus trees provide both for them), but all the more so if it is a physical 
            struggle to do so and if these are being destroyed at a terrifying rate. It is the latter matter that has made its way
            into headlines around the world.</p>

        <p>As you may have seen or read recently, wildfires have been rampaging across parts of Australia. These fires, which were 
            very concerning as early as Fall (Spring for Australia) 2019, have continued to devastate large swaths of land and in 
            doing so, pose an enormous threat not only to human lives, but tragically also to koalas. Their suffering has become
            the focus of a fair amount of media attention, in no small part because this is an issue that koalas are largely
            incapable of dealing with on their own. Unable to escape to other areas, koalas retreat into the heights of their tree
            homes, but find little refuge from fires which have become increasingly severe due to climate change, or even just the 
            deadly smoke the fires produce. Brave efforts have certainly been made to save all lives affected by these recent fires
            but as this issue worsens due to environmental changes and firefighting resources are stretched to the max, many fear that 
            this latest wave of disasters is only further endangering the koala population. 
        </p>

        <p>This has all raised the discussion about the controversal aforementioned claim: that koalas are "functionally extinct", that
            is to say that they are in irrevocable decline. Scientists have reacted strongly against this notion, concerned that this
            perspective will only discourage further efforts to save the species. It seems like we need both positions: a very strong
            feeling of concern, in concert with a healthy dose of optimism and willpower to do all that we can to save this species. We
            can see the danger, our role in their decline makes our responsibilities clear, and we have the power to act. Find out how
