            <!-- ABOUT KOALAS -->
            <h1>About Koalas</h1>

            <p>
                Koalas, also known as Phascolarctos cinereus, are an herbivorous creature native to Australia. 
                Although they are sometimes called the koala bear, they are far from being related to any bear. 
                Koalas are marsupials, meaning their young are raised in the safety of a pouch, which bears lack. 
                Koalas' closest living relative is the wombat, meaning they should always be referred to as a koala, never a koala bear.
            </p>

            <p>
                Koalas are sexually dimorphic, meaning that male and female koalas exhibit different characteristics outside of reproductive organs. 
                Male koalas are typically 50% larger than their female counterparts and will usually have a more curved nose. 
                Koalas have one of the smallest brains in proportion to the body mass of any other mammal. 
                Their brains are also on the smooth side, where rigidness is typically associated with creature intelligence.
            </p>

            <p>
                Koalas typically live in eucalypt (gum tree) woodlands and spend most of their lives doing little physical activity. 
                Their diet mainly consists of leaves of the eucalyptus trees, but they also may occasionally eat leaves off other native trees.
                Koalas are mostly asocial animals, meaning they will spend their time isolated from one another, the exception being when a child is dependent on their mother. 
                Due to Koalas being marsupials, they will give birth to underdeveloped young who depend on their mother’s pouches for typically half a year. 
                These baby koalas are called joeys.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, these joeys and their mothers are currently in a situation where they are all plagued by chlamydia, where certain regions that house koalas have a 100% infection rate. 
                Chlamydia in koalas frequently lead to blindness, severe bladder inflammation, infertility, and even death. 
                Treatment for koalas with antibiotics is possible but it doesn't solve the problem. 
                Antibiotics are a disruptive solution to koalas due to how they will affect their gut microbe ecology. 
                Koalas’ guts contain bacteria that is specially made to break down and process eucalyptus leaves, which we learned are compose their main diet. 
                If antibiotics were to be used, the koalas would be unable to consume anymore eucalyptus leaves, meaning they would likely die of processing any newly ingested leaves or starve to death. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease, so it makes sense for male and female koalas to contract them due to the nature of mating and producing offspring. 
                However, joeys contract chlamydia just the same, and this is due to joeys eating chlamydia infected pap. 
                Pap is a nutrient rich type of feces, and in this case, the mother koalas will produce pap to feed to their offspring to provide a start to their gut microbe ecology.
                This is due to joeys lacking the bacteria to process eucalyptus leaves at birth. Even with this problem running rampant in koalas, they have stayed strong surviving in Australia, however this situation has changed ever so slightly in recent events

            <!-- ENDANGERED STATUS -->
            <h2>Endangered Status</h2>
            <h3>Are koalas an endangered species?</h3>

            <p>A quick Google search reveals that koalas are "not extinct", and that they are not on an endangered species list. 
                Whew - nothing to worry about, right? Well...not exactly. While there has been insightful backlash and complaints
                of exaggeration, many people are concerned about the dangers facing the koala populations, and Deborah Tabart, 
                head of the Australian Koala Foundation, went as far as to claim that koalas are "functionally extinct" in May of
                2019. So what exactly <i>is</i> going on?</p>

            <p>While recent news has sparked conversation about their future, koalas have been recognized as vulnerable for several
                years and the story of their declining numbers is, unfortunately, neither new nor different from that suffered by 
                many other species. All of the aspects of negative human impact on our world and its biodiversity can be found in 
                this story. Large numbers lost to satisfy human hunting and fur trading in the 19th and 20th centuries. The 
                <i>continued</i> destruction of their natural habitats, either by direct or indirect human intervention. Insufficient
                human protection efforts and reaction. The threat of motor vehicle accidents or dog attacks when displaced from their 
                environments and attempting to relocate. Except all of these factors are exacerbated by the lethargic and helpless 
                nature of these adorable and sleepy creatures. It is difficult for any species to cope with the destruction of their
                safe retreats and food supplies (Eucalyptus trees provide both for them), but all the more so if it is a physical 
                struggle to do so and if these are being destroyed at a terrifying rate. It is the latter matter that has made its way
                into headlines around the world.</p>

            <p> 
                As you may have seen or read recently, wildfires have been rampaging across parts of Australia. These fires, which were 
                very concerning as early as Fall (Spring for Australia) 2019, have continued to devastate large swaths of land and in 
                doing so, pose an enormous threat not only to human lives, but tragically also to koalas. Their suffering has become
                the focus of a fair amount of media attention, in no small part because this is an issue that koalas are largely
                incapable of dealing with on their own. Unable to escape to other areas, koalas retreat into the heights of their tree
                homes, but find little refuge from fires which have become increasingly severe due to climate change, or even just the 
                deadly smoke the fires produce. Brave efforts have certainly been made to save all lives affected by these recent fires
                but as this issue worsens due to environmental changes and firefighting resources are stretched to the max, many fear that 
                this latest wave of disasters is only further endangering the koala population. 
            </p>

            <p>This has all raised the discussion about the controversal aforementioned claim: that koalas are "functionally extinct", that
                is to say that they are in irrevocable decline. Scientists have reacted strongly against this notion, concerned that this
                perspective will only discourage further efforts to save the species. It seems like we need both positions: a very strong
                feeling of concern, in concert with a healthy dose of optimism and willpower to do all that we can to save this species. We
                can see the danger, our role in their decline makes our responsibilities clear, and we have the power to act. Find out how
