        <h3>Are koalas an endangered species?</h3>

        <p>A quick Google search reveals that koalas are "not extinct", and that they are not on an endangered species list. 
            Whew - nothing to worry about, right? Well...not exactly. While there has been insightful backlash and complaints
            of exaggeration, many people are concerned about the dangers facing the koala populations, and Deborah Tabart, 
            head of the Australian Koala Foundation, went as far as to claim that koalas are "functionally extinct" in May of
            2019. So what exactly is going on?</p>

        <p>While recent news has sparked conversation about their future, koalas have been recognized as vulnerable for several
            years. </p>
